This project is a part of the Data Visualization course and aims to visualize online gaming industry data using various data visualization libraries such as D3.js, Chart.js, and Plotly.js. The visualizations are designed to cater to three different user groups: Players, Engineers, and Business Persons (Companies).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to present the online gaming industry data in an aesthetically pleasing and easily understandable manner. The visualizations are designed to minimize cognitive load and require minimal prior knowledge about graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
- **Chart.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for creating responsive and highly customizable charts and graphs.
- **Plotly.js**: A high-level, declarative charting library built on top of D3.js and stack.gl.

## User Groups

The visualizations are tailored to meet the specific needs of the following user groups:

1. **Players**: Visualizations focused on providing insights into game trends, popular genres, and player demographics.
2. **Engineers**: Visualizations highlighting technical aspects such as game performance, hardware requirements, and software optimizations.
3. **Business Persons (Companies)**: Visualizations showcasing market trends, revenue streams, and potential growth opportunities.
